Overview

Favour.jav is a simple Java application demonstrating basic programming concepts such as enum, super classes, sub classes,etc.

Code Explanation

Main Class

The `Main` class serves as the application entry point.

```
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        WeekDay[] days = WeekDay.values();

        for (WeekDay day : days) {
            SpecificDay specificDay = new SpecificDay(day);
            specificDay.displayDay();
        }
    }
}
```

SpecificDay Class

The `SpecificDay` class serves as a super class for the sub classes.

```
public class SpecificDay extends Day {
    public SpecificDay(WeekDay day) {
        super(day);
    }

    @Override
    public void displayDay() {
        System.out.println("Today is " + getDay());
    }
}
```

Day Class

The `Day` class manages the week cycle .

```
public abstract class Day {
    private WeekDay day;

    public Day(WeekDay day) {
        this.day = day;
    }

    public WeekDay getDay() {
        return day;
    }

    public abstract void displayDay();
}
```
Weekday Class

The `weekday` class represent the data for the days of the week.

```
public enum WeekDay {
    MONDAY,
    TUESDAY,
    WEDNESDAY,
    THURSDAY,
    FRIDAY,
    SATURDAY,
    SUNDAY
}
```
